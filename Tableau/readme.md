**Tableau assignments and practices**

In this section, we learned about functionalities in Tableau, such as the difference between dimension and measure (green and blue pills), 
how to make various plots, and how to make dashboards and stories. Some of the work is posted on [my Tableau public page](https://public.tableau.com/profile/xiaona2089#!/). 
We did not have the time to master all the techniques, and I'm planning to take another course on Tableau soon.

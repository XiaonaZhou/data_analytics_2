# Python assignments and Projects:

1. In **Unit 2**, we learned about the basics of Python, such as list, dictionary, and build-in functions. We also learned about for loop, if-else statement, and so on. 

   a. [Link to the assignment file](https://github.com/XiaonaZhou/data_analytics_2/blob/main/Python/Unit_2/Unit_2_lesson_2%263%264%265%266.ipynb)
   
   b. We have two mini projects for this unit.
      - Check if the input is odd or even, if it is multiple of 4. More generally, define a function that takes in two numbers and check whether the first number is divisible by the second. 
      - Rock, paper, scissor game: define a function that takes two inputs and determine who wins.

2. In **unit 3**, we learned about the functions within *numpy*, *pandas*, and *matplotlib* packages. We see examples of data wrangling and data visualization. 
   
   a. In [assignment 1](https://github.com/XiaonaZhou/data_analytics_2/blob/main/Python/Unit_3/Unit3_NumPy_Assignment_1.ipynb), I practiced using *numpy* package to find the maximum within an array, and subset array according to certain criteria. 
   
   b. In [assignment 2](https://github.com/XiaonaZhou/data_analytics_2/blob/main/Python/Unit_3/Unit3_Python_Advanced_Pandas_DataWrangling_Assignment.ipynb), I did data analysis using salaries dataset. I calculated mean, median, and I did basic data transformations on the dataset, such as rename and subset columns. I visualized the dataset by making scatter plots and histogram. Lastly, I draw conclusions based on the plots. 
   
   c. The project for this unit is on the hot topic of the year, COVID 19. The codes for the first 4 tasks were set up clearly. After carefully reading all the codes and statements, I did some analysis on the states that have high death case. I answered the following questions:
   
      - Which five states have the highest number of death?
      - Analysis on COVID 19 in the 5 states since December 22nd. 
      - A different approach on calculating new cases.

3. In **Unit 3**, we learned about Mechine Learning. More specificly, we learned various ML methods such as linear regression, logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, decision trees, and random forest. 
   a. We use linear regression to predict Boston housing price. I got $RMSE = 4.64$ and $R^2 =  0.69$. The outcome was not satisfying, and I was able to get better result with decision tree. [Linear regression Notebook]()
   b. We worked on two examples on using logistic regression. We learned about confusion matrix, the difference between recall, precision, and accuracy, what is ROC-curve and how to interprete it.    
      - [Predict survival with Titanic dataset](https://github.com/XiaonaZhou/data_analytics_2/blob/main/Python/Unit_4/Logistic_Regression_Titanic_Class_Notes.ipynb)
      - [Predict ad clicking behavior with advertising dataset](https://github.com/XiaonaZhou/data_analytics_2/blob/main/Python/Unit_4/Logistic_regression_predict_ad_click.ipynb)
   c. We use `Classified` dataset to examine KNN method. We learned about how to standardize data, how different K-values change predictions, and how to pick the right K-value.
      - [Predict class with classified dataset](https://github.com/XiaonaZhou/data_analytics_2/blob/main/Python/Unit_4/KNN_with_Classified_dataset.ipynb)
   d. Decision trees can be used on both classification and regression problems.
